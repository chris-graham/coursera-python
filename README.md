Collection of programs written for Coursera's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course

A note to students current enrolled in this course
--------------------------------------------------
If you are a student in this course, do not pull this repository. The course is designed to teach you interactive programming in Python. Copying code from this repo will not further your understanding of the topic. The only value you get from completing the course is what you learn. Plagerizing others' work will only hurt you. Stick with it, study hard, concentrate. If I can do this, anyone can.

Description of repository contents
----------------------------------
Coursera's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course consisted of building 8 games using event-driven programming in Python (the 8th game builds additional functionality on top of the 7th game, so I omitted the 7th from this repo). To simplify things, professor Scott Rixner, of Rice University, built the [Code Skulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org) browser based development environment to allow students to focus on writing code and not configuring their development environment. Additionally, Dr. Rixner built a simplified GUI library named <i>simplegui</i> to provide students a more simple way to build interactive programs. Because Code Skuptor is browser based, <i>simplegui</i> is implemented in Javascript and not portable to local Python development environments.

How to run the code
-------------------
There are two methods to running the code from any of the files in this repo.

1. Copy the code from the file
2. Go to [codeskuptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org) in your browser (I suggest using Chrome, Firefox or Safari)
3. Delete the starter code
4. Paste the code from your clipboard
5. Click the play icon in the upper left hand corner to run the program

**For more information on Code Skuptor, you may refer to the docs in the upper right hand corner of the site**

The second method for running the code is to simply use my link to the program in Code Skuptor which is listed in the next section.
